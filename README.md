# ELO calculator
I don't really intend for people to use this, its mostly just here for version control. I put a lot of work into building it and if my laptop died I'd lose it.\
It relies on a mySQL database running in XAMPP on localhost. So you'd have to set one up yourself to make these scripts work.\
I may in future refactor this all to run in a nodeJS server so I can have my data be in json files and stored in the git too for further safety of laptop death.
